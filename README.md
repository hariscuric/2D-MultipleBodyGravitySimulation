# 2D-MultipleBodyGravitySimulation

This program runs 2D simulation of multiple bodies' motions in eachothers' gravity fields. Simulation parameters are defined in a .csv file. Example input.csv file is provided which creates a three body problem. To run the program, from terminal input "python main.py". Prompt will ask you to input the name of the csv file. Input "input.csv" and press enter. You will get a beautiful simulation of three body motion.

This program is still in development. Testing is in progress... Animation should also be improved (maybe by displaying bodies in different colors)...

Here is a snapshot from the animation:
